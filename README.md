#Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
<br>
Breast cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening cancers affecting women globally. Early detection plays a vital role in improving survival rates and reducing unnecessary treatment. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on features extracted from digitized images of breast cell nuclei.
